# Introduction

**x7** (pronounced "except") is a stack-based pseudo-golfing language. While ostensibly a language meant to be used for golfing, it is more of a toy project to explore novel golfing ideas
and it is not explicitly designed to minimize byte count. Instead, it aims for more of a middle ground that makes the language an accessible testing ground while still remaining terse and
(hopefully) fun to golf and program in.

The language's main draw is its control flow based entirely on "raises", which work much like exceptions in Python or Java. The goal of
this system is to allow a programmer to elide explicit checks and control edge cases more easily by structuring their code carefully.

This book provides documentation for the syntax and features of x7, as well as a list of all of its built-in instructions. Though informal, it is the language's primary specification
and can serve both as a reference and as a gentle introduction.
